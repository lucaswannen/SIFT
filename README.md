# SIFT

The "Application" part is an implementation of the SIFT algorithm, which consisted of creating an object detector in a real time setting.

The "Implementation" part is a reimplementation of the sift algorithm, performed by Pierre Millet.


Theory, explanations and description of the code are available in description_du_code.pdf
